Intelligent System Design Language (ISDL) is a custom programming language that enables you to create professional Virtual Tabletop Systems in hours, not months. It generates modern Foundry VTT systems compatible with Foundry V12 and V13 using cutting-edge web technologies.

ISDL provides both a **VS Code extension** and **CLI tool** for development, featuring syntax highlighting, intelligent validation, autocomplete, and seamless GitHub integration for publishing and sharing your systems.

## ‚ú® Key Features

### üé® Modern User Interface
* **Vue 3 + Vuetify** powered reactive character sheets for smooth, responsive gameplay
* **Advanced DataTables** with search, filter, sort, and drag-drop functionality - perfect for managing inventories and spell lists
* **Edit vs Play Mode** toggle for clear distinction between character building and gameplay
* **Responsive Design** optimized for desktop and tablet use

### ‚ö° Enhanced Active Effects
* **Visual Editor** integration for creating effects through the familiar Foundry interface  
* **Smart Targeting** with automatic field detection and validation
* **Condition Management** with built-in status effect handling

### üé≤ Intelligent Game Mechanics  
* **Smart Dice Operations** - multiply a d4 by 2 and get a d8, because that makes sense for tabletop games
* **Enhanced Roll System** showing detailed breakdowns with labeled components
* **Conditional Visibility** - show Ki trackers only for Monks, spell slots only for casters, etc.
* **Resource Management** with automatic token bar integration and damage application

### üîó Seamless Publishing & Sharing
* **GitHub Integration** - authenticate, publish systems, and manage releases directly from VS Code
* **Automated Versioning** with semantic version detection based on your ISDL changes
* **Gist Sharing** for quick collaboration and system prototypes
* **Quality Releases** with auto-generated installation instructions and changelogs

### üõ†Ô∏è Developer Experience
* **VS Code Extension** with full language support, syntax highlighting, and intelligent autocomplete
* **CLI Tool** for build automation and CI/CD integration
* **Real-time Validation** catching errors as you type
* **Minimal Setup Needed** so you can get started easily

## üöÄ Quick Start

Ready to create your first system? Choose your preferred development environment:

### üìù **VS Code Extension** (Recommended)
1. Install the [ISDL extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=IronMooseDevelopment.fsdl) from the VS Code marketplace
2. Create a new `.isdl` file and start coding with full intellisense support
3. Use `Ctrl+Shift+P` ‚Üí `ISDL - Generate` to create your Foundry system
4. Connect to GitHub for easy publishing and sharing

## üéØ Design Philosophy

### 1: Programming made easy, but still light programming

Systems like Simple World Building, Custom System Builder, and Sandbox all offer a no-code click based way to build out small lightweight systems.

ISDL is not nearly as complicated as developing a full Foundry system from scratch, but it is still a programming language. Basic familiarity with scripting languages as Javascript will be useful.

### 2: Do what makes sense

There are a lot of options and customization available, but if you use the default syntax it should provide a reasonable default.

When working with Datatypes like a list of Die size choices, most languages would reject `self.DieSize += 1` - adding `1` to a string doesn't make sense for most languages. For ISDL, we raise the value to the next die size, because that's what makes sense for Tabletop games. Multiply a d4 by 2? Now you have a d8.

### 3: Just enough Typing

Some programming languages have no typing, meaning you can pass a number to something that expects a string and the function will have to deal with it - or error. Even simple typos can error.

Other languages provide fully enforced typing which protects you from these mistakes, but can add a lot of extra work doing type conversions and checks.

ISDL provides just enough typing to protect yourself from things like typos and errors, without requiring a ton of extra work.
